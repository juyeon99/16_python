Baby, watch your mouth (mouth)
It come back around ('round)
Once upon a time (time)
We learned how to fly (fly)
Go look at your mirror, same damn clothes (git)
You know how I feel? 개행복 (turn up)

How many hours do we fly? (Ooh)
I keep on dreamin' on the cloud (hah)
Yeah, I'm on the mountain, yeah, I'm on the bay (pop)
Everyday we vibin', mic drop, bam
